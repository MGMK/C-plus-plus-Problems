# Wordlist

Many English word lists can be found online, however, they all vary in length, meaning they each have discrepancies. This project compiles multiple word lists into one master list.

`master.txt` contains almost 300,000 words.

# Resources
This wordlist is compiled by a Python program using the following resources:

| File Name (in the `/res/` directory) | Words In File | Resource |
